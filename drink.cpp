//Usage examples: The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in C++ world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.
//Identification: The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object.
